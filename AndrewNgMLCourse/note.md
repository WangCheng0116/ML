## Gradient Descent  
The idea behind gradient descent is as follows: Initially, we randomly select a combination of parameters (θ₀, θ₁, ..., θₙ), calculate the cost function, and then look for the next combination of parameters that will cause the cost function to decrease the most. We continue to do this until we reach a local minimum because we haven't tried all possible parameter combinations, so we cannot be sure if the local minimum we find is the global minimum. Choosing different initial parameter combinations may lead to different local minima.

In gradient descent, as we approach a local minimum, the algorithm automatically takes smaller steps. This is because when we get close to a local minimum, it's evident that the derivative (gradient) equals zero at that point. Consequently, as we approach the local minimum, the gradient values naturally become smaller, leading the gradient descent to automatically adopt smaller step sizes. This is the essence of how gradient descent works. Therefore, there's actually no need for further decreasing the learning rate (alpha).  

## Apply Gradient Descent into linear regression model  
the key here is to find the partial derivative of model parameter

this method would sometimes also be referred as "Batch Gradient Descent", because each step makes use of all training datas
