# Machine Learning Daily Blog  

## Sept 28  
Today is officially the first day of my journey in Machine Learning. During the conversation with Prof Soh, he recommended I first learn the concept of random forest and gradient boosted, but I feel like I might start from the whole picture of ML and then dive into those two topics meticulously. The material that I opted for is from Andrew Ng, a pretty well-known course. And today I managed to finish the following chapters. I took special notice of math formulas, so I wrote all the steps in a rigorous mathematical manner. 

* Linear Regression with one variable
* Matrix Review
* Linear Regression with multiple variables
* Features and Polynomial Regression
* Logistic Regression

I GOT DRIVEN CRAZY BY BP PROOF!!!  
I have watched at least five different videos and none of them explain this thoroughly, in the end, I have no choice but to use plain math. What torture it is(I hate all those subscripts and superscripts in NN. HATE THEM!).

Today what I have learned:
* Regularization
* Neural Networks
* Neural Networks: Learning
