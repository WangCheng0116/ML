# Machine Learning Daily Blog  

## Sept 28  
Today is offcially the first day of my journey of Machine Learning. During the conversaiton of Prof Soh, he recommended me to first learn the concept of random forest and gradient boosted, but I feel like I might start from the whole pictuer of ML and then dive into those two topics maticuously. The matetial that I opted for is from Andrew Ng, a pretty well-known course. And today I managed to finish the following chapters. I took special notice to math formulas, so I wrote all the steps in a rigorous mathematical manner. 

* Linear Regression with one variable
* Matrix Review
* Linear Regression with multiple variables
* Features and Polynomial Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Regularization
* Neural Networks
* Neural Networks: Learning
